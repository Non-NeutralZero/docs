# Decision Trees

*   On each node, a decision tree asks a question and answers it with yes/no to classify observations under that node.
*   The question could be based on a specific True/False *(is obs.feature = something)* question or could be based on numeric data *(is obs.feature > 10)*

*   The classification can be categorical or numerical
*   The first node is called the **Root node**, the nodes in the middle are called **internal nodes**, and the results are called **leaf nodes**
